## Purpose of the repo
This repo is a website designed to practice using third party APIs within JavaScript to manipulate objects and pass values through the local storage to make changes persistent. The website will allow a user to press a button, activating a modal form where the user will input a task name, due date and task description, with input validation to make sure that each field is filled out before the task can be created. Task information will be displayed on a bootstap card with different styling depending on how close the due date is to the current date. Task that are due today or are overdue will appear to be red. Tasks that are nearing today, within 3 days will appear yellow, and tasks that have >3 days left beore the due date will appear with a white background. Tasks are initially placed in the todo status and can be dragged to either in progress or complete status's. Tasks will remain in their current status area when the page is refreshed. Pressing the delete button at the bottom of the task card will delete that task permenantly from the webpage and from local storage.
